## About Project
```
Weekly Task App was made to learn the basics of Vue.js - front-end focus.
The first iteration was to create a functional app without any sort of backend.
The second iteration hooked up the application to a JSON server.
The next Vue project will be to create a full-stack application with Vue and MySQL.
